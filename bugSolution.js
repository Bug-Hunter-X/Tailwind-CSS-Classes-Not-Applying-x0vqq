```javascript
// Ensure correct Tailwind configuration and setup.
// Check for CSS specificity conflicts. If other CSS rules are overriding Tailwind classes,
// use !important (though this is generally not recommended) or adjust your CSS selectors to
// have higher specificity than the conflicting rules.

// Check for typos in class names.
<div class="bg-red-500 p-4">
  <p>This text should be red and have padding.</p>
</div>

// Verify Tailwind's purge configuration if using PurgeCSS to ensure that only the necessary
// classes are included in the final CSS output.  If not configured correctly, it can remove
// classes in your component if it's not used often enough
